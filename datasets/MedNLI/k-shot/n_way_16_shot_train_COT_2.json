The hypothesis suggests that the patient had an MI, which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. While MI is a possible cause for the patient's symptoms, it is not confirmed in the premise, so the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 5700, "Premise": "She was tranported via ambulance to [**Hospital1 22**] for continued trauma care.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has a history of trauma.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "First, the premise states that the patient was transported to the hospital for continued trauma care, which implies that the patient has experienced some kind of traumatic event. This traumatic event could be related to physical injury, emotional distress, or both. Therefore, the hypothesis that the patient has a history of trauma is logically entailed by the premise. Thus, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 3121, "Premise": "She received antibiotics about a half hour prior to delivery.", "Hypothesis": "the patient did not recieve antibiotics", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient received antibiotics before delivery, while the hypothesis suggests that she did not receive antibiotics.

The Hypothesis makes an assumption about the patient's history, but there is no evidence to support or refute this assumption in the Premise. Therefore, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 5452, "Premise": "During that admission the patient had a clotted AV graft that required thrombectomy.", "Hypothesis": "patient has normal kidneys", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise mentions that the patient had a clotted AV graft that required thrombectomy, which indicates a problem with the patient's vascular access for hemodialysis. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that the patient has normal kidneys, which is a completely different aspect of their health. Therefore, the two statements contradict each other and cannot both be true at the same time, leading to the label contradiction."}
{"idx": 2483, "Premise": "In summary, this is 72 yo M with severe COPD admitted with SOB and tremors.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has asthma", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient is a 72-year-old male with severe COPD, who was admitted with shortness of breath and tremors. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the patient has asthma. Since there is a clear discrepancy between the premise and the hypothesis, the label is neutral. The premise does not provide any information that supports or refutes the hypothesis, so it cannot be categorized as positive or negative."}
{"idx": 5450, "Premise": "Apgar nine at seven and one minute and eight at five minutes.", "Hypothesis": "the patient is premature", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise provides information about the Apgar score of the patient, which is a measure of the newborn's physical condition immediately after birth. However, the score alone does not indicate whether the patient is premature or not. Prematurity is determined by the gestational age of the baby, which is not mentioned in the premise or the hypothesis. Therefore, the label is neutral."}

Therefore, the information in the premise (improvement of mental status) logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis (the patient had altered mental status). Hence, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 11008, "Premise": "She is planned to have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement today.", "Hypothesis": "She is receive nutrition by mouth", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The Premise states that the patient is scheduled to have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed, which is a medical procedure to provide nutrition directly to the stomach. In contrast, the Hypothesis implies that the patient is receiving nutrition by mouth, which would make the need for a PEG tube unnecessary. Therefore, the Premise and Hypothesis contradict each other, leading to the label of contradiction."}
{"idx": 7034, "Premise": "She was discharged on Lasix 20 MG PO QD, and soon redeveloped shortness of breath, LE edema and lethargy prompting her re-presentation to [**Hospital1 68**] on [**2731-8-15**].", "Hypothesis": "The patient was not taking her medications.", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient was discharged on Lasix 20 MG PO QD, which is a medication used to treat fluid retention and shortness of breath. The premise also mentions that the patient redeveloped shortness of breath, LE edema, and lethargy, which are symptoms that suggest fluid retention. However, the hypothesis only states that the patient was not taking her medications, but it does not provide any evidence or explanation for why this might be the case. Therefore, the label is neutral because the premise and hypothesis do not provide enough information to support or refute the hypothesis."}
{"idx": 4022, "Premise": "She was treated with levofloxacin, no bug was cultured, she did improve somewhat.", "Hypothesis": "She was treated for pneumonia", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The Premise informs us that the patient was treated with levofloxacin and that no bug was cultured. The Hypothesis then suggests that the patient was treated for pneumonia. However, the Premise does not explicitly state the reason for the treatment, so we cannot confirm or deny the Hypothesis. Therefore, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 2669, "Premise": "The patient also mentioned that he had He had no emesis once he got to the Emergency Room and he states this never happened to him before.", "Hypothesis": "He has viral gastroenteritis", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise mentions that the patient did not have emesis (vomiting) which was unusual for him.

These two statements cannot both be true since a cesarean section involves surgical delivery, whereas vaginal birth occurs naturally. Therefore, the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 4953, "Premise": "No change in exerciese tolerance, no leg swelling, or symptoms of claudication.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has no exercise induced leg pain.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "If there is no change in exercise tolerance, it means the patient can still perform the same level of physical activity without experiencing any difficulties. If there is no leg swelling or symptoms of claudication (pain, cramping, or fatigue in the legs during exercise), it implies that the patient has no exercise induced leg pain. Therefore, the premise logically entails the hypothesis, and the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 4627, "Premise": "The patient was started on a beta blocker, nitroglycerin, heparin, and Integrilin and taken emergently to the catheterization laboratory.", "Hypothesis": "Patient requires no intervention", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The Premise mentions multiple interventions for the patient, which indicates that there is an urgent medical need. However, the Hypothesis claims that the patient requires no intervention, which contradicts the Premise. Therefore, the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 11093, "Premise": "Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted and recommended Vitamin K, FFP, octreotide gtt and transfer to [**Hospital1 22**] for variceal banding.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has a history of cirrhosis", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise mentions a consultation with a doctor and recommendations for specific treatments and transfer to another hospital for a procedure. There is no direct mention of cirrhosis in the premise, although the recommended treatments suggest that the patient may have liver-related issues. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the patient has a history of cirrhosis, which is not explicitly stated in the premise. Therefore, the label is neutral as the hypothesis is not directly supported or contradicted by the information in the premise."}
{"idx": 1051, "Premise": "The patient was started on heparin drip, nitro drip, aspirin, Plavix, and beta-blocker.", "Hypothesis": "The patient received no medication", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient was started on several medications, while the hypothesis suggests that the patient received no medication.

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a type of open heart surgery. Therefore, if the patient has undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery, it logically follows that they have had prior open heart surgery. The hypothesis directly states that the patient has had prior open heart surgery, which is a logical conclusion based on the premise. Therefore, the label is entailment, as the hypothesis is entailed by the premise."}
{"idx": 9734, "Premise": "61 yo F with CAD, CHF EF 30%, ESRD s/p transplant, now failed who presents with pulmonary edema, AoCRF and need for dialysis.", "Hypothesis": "patient is immunocompromised", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise describes the patient's medical history and current symptoms, but it does not provide any information about the patient's immune system.

This means that the patient has lung cancer. The hypothesis states that the patient has lung cancer without distant metastatic disease. This is a logical conclusion based on the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the information in the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis, resulting in the label entailment."}
{"idx": 5042, "Premise": "On hospital day four, his creatinine had elevated to 1.5 and they stopped his diuresis.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has a history of congestive heart failure", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise provides information about the patient's creatinine level and the cessation of diuresis. While these can be indicative of congestive heart failure, they are not conclusive evidence. Moreover, the hypothesis only suggests a history of the condition, which is not confirmed or denied by the premise. Therefore, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 3705, "Premise": "Catheterization showed the right internal coronary artery with calcified 70% lesion at the bifurcation with the right external carotid artery.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has atherosclerosis", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "Catheterization is a procedure to examine blood vessels, and in this case, it showed a calcified lesion in the right internal coronary artery. Atherosclerosis is a condition in which plaque builds up in the arteries, causing them to narrow and harden. The calcified lesion is a sign of plaque buildup, which is a characteristic of atherosclerosis. Therefore, the presence of a calcified lesion in the internal coronary artery entails that the patient has atherosclerosis. Hence, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 11085, "Premise": "In the cath lab, fluid was administered and a dopamine infusion begun for hypotension during the intervention.", "Hypothesis": "the patient was hypotensive", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that fluid was administered and a dopamine infusion was started for hypotension during the intervention. This means that the patient was experiencing low blood pressure, as evidenced by the need for these interventions. Therefore, the hypothesis that the patient was hypotensive follows logically from the premise, resulting in an entailment label."}
{"idx": 7455, "Premise": "He did develop a progressive hyperbilirubinemia which was found to be largely indirect and was thought to be likely hemolysis in the setting of receiving blood transfusions.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has elevated T. bili levels", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient developed hyperbilirubinemia, which means high levels of bilirubin in the blood. The hypothesis specifically mentions elevated T. bili levels, which is a type of bilirubin. Therefore, the information in the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. This is why the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 802, "Premise": "HISTORY: 73-year-old woman with GI bleed localize to hepatic flexure on tagged red blood cell scan.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has normal RBC nuclear medicine scan", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The Premise states that the woman has a GI bleed localized to the hepatic flexure on a tagged red blood cell scan. This suggests a medical issue or abnormality. The Hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that the patient has a normal RBC nuclear medicine scan. This implies that there is no abnormality or medical issue present. Since the Premise and Hypothesis present opposite ideas about the woman's medical condition, the label of contradiction is appropriate."}
{"idx": 1938, "Premise": "OSH CTH revealed an evolving SDH with an ABG of 7.48/22/78 on RA, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 22**] for further evaluation.", "Hypothesis": "CT scan of the head revealed subdural hematoma", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise mentions that an OSH CTH (outside hospital computed tomography head) revealed an evolving SDH (subdural hematoma) and the patient was transferred to another hospital for further evaluation. The hypothesis specifically mentions that a CT scan of the head revealed subdural hematoma. Since the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 7473, "Premise": "She was treated with IV fluids to maintain her BP which held stable with SBPs in the 80s.", "Hypothesis": "The patient is hypotensive.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "If the patient's blood pressure was maintained with IV fluids, it means that the patient's blood pressure was initially low or hypotensive. Therefore, the information in the premise (IV fluids used to maintain BP in the 80s) logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis (the patient is hypotensive). So the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 6811, "Premise": "As the patient usually has minimal complaints, she contact[**Name (NI) **] her physician who recommended ER evaluation.", "Hypothesis": "The patient self referred herself to the ED.", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient contacted her physician who recommended ER evaluation, which means that the patient did not self-refer herself to the ED. However, the hypothesis claims that the patient did self-refer herself to the ED. Therefore, there is a contradiction between the two statements, and the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 9448, "Premise": "Patient taken off of dopamine before transfer to [**Hospital1 **].", "Hypothesis": "The patient was continued on dopamine", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient was taken off of dopamine before transfer to the hospital, meaning that the patient was not receiving dopamine anymore. However, the hypothesis contradicts this by claiming that the patient was continued on dopamine. Therefore, the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 3897, "Premise": "Mother did receive antibiotics in labor for positive GBS, however, she received less than 4 hours worth of antibiotics while in labor.", "Hypothesis": "The baby is at risk for group B strep infection.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the mother received antibiotics during labor for positive GBS, but for less than 4 hours. Group B strep (GBS) is a bacteria that can cause infection in newborns if the mother carries it and does not receive sufficient antibiotics during labor. Therefore, the hypothesis that the baby is at risk for GBS infection logically follows from the information provided in the premise, making it an entailment."}
{"idx": 3095, "Premise": "Based on the above findings, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization.", "Hypothesis": "patient has an acute MI", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise tells us that the patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization, which is a diagnostic procedure used to assess the heart's function and identify blockages in the coronary arteries. While this information may suggest the possibility of heart disease, it does not confirm or deny the presence of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 10962, "Premise": "He also had hematuria, but no evidence of BK virus.", "Hypothesis": "The has red blood cells in his urine.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "Hematuria means the presence of red blood cells in the urine. The premise explicitly mentions that the patient had hematuria, so it logically follows that the hypothesis that the patient has red blood cells in his urine is true. Therefore, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 10135, "Premise": "After workup and discussion at tumor conference it was decided with the patient to schedule a gastrectomy.", "Hypothesis": "the patient is not an operative canidate", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The Premise suggests that the patient has been evaluated and a decision has been made to schedule a gastrectomy (a surgical procedure to remove part or all of the stomach) in consultation with the patient. On the other hand, the Hypothesis claims that the patient is not an operative candidate, which means the patient is not suitable for surgery. These two statements are in direct opposition to each other, indicating a contradiction."}

However, it does not provide any information about the patient's ECG or any other diagnostic tests that would confirm the presence of STEMI. Therefore, the hypothesis that the patient has STEMI cannot be confirmed or refuted based on the given information. Hence, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 248, "Premise": "She had no fevers/chills/sweats prior to coming to the hosptial.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has a normal abdominal CT", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient did not have fevers, chills, or sweats before coming to the hospital. The hypothesis suggests that the patient's abdominal CT is normal. However, there is no clear connection between the two statements. The absence of fevers, chills, or sweats does not necessarily indicate a normal abdominal CT, and vice versa. Therefore, the label is neutral as there is no conclusive evidence to support or refute the hypothesis."}
