{"idx": 2395, "Premise": "The patient had also noticed increased fatigue during sexual intercourse.", "Hypothesis": "The patient does not have sexual intercourse.", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise mentions that the patient has noticed increased fatigue during sexual intercourse, implying that the patient engages in sexual activity. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that the patient does not have sexual intercourse. These two statements contradict each other, and hence the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 2400, "Premise": "Today he decided he wanted to live and therefore called EMS to bring him to [**Hospital1 22**].", "Hypothesis": "The patient requested to go to the hospital.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient called EMS to bring him to Hospital1. The hypothesis states that the patient requested to go to the hospital. It is clear that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise because the patient's decision to call EMS and go to Hospital1 can be seen as a request to go to the hospital. Therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, and the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 1759, "Premise": "Due to his uncontrolled HTN and stable SDH, he was transferred to the MICU for further management.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has a normal blood pressure.", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient has uncontrolled hypertension, which means that their blood pressure is high and needs further management.

Now, to confirm whether the hypothesis is true or not, we need to know the normal range of platelet levels. If the normal range is higher or lower than 278, then the hypothesis is false. However, if the normal range includes 278, then the hypothesis is true. But the premise itself confirms that the platelet levels are within normal limits (not high or low), which directly and clearly confirms the hypothesis. Therefore, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 5661, "Premise": "Pt was found to be in DKA with BS 384 and anion gap 17, given 5 u insulin and placed on insulin gtt.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has hyperglycemia", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "DKA stands for diabetic ketoacidosis, which is a serious complication of diabetes. One of the defining features of DKA is hyperglycemia, which is reflected in the given blood sugar value of 384. The administration of insulin is a standard treatment for hyperglycemia, as it helps to lower blood sugar levels. Therefore, it logically follows that the patient has hyperglycemia. This is why the label for this premise-hypothesis pair is entailment."}
{"idx": 3742, "Premise": "Pt presented to OSH on [**7-6**] with SOB and O2 sat of 82% and pt intubated.", "Hypothesis": "the patient is not hypoxic", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient presented with low oxygen saturation (O2 sat of 82%) and required intubation. The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the patient is not hypoxic. These two statements contradict each other because low O2 saturation is a sign of hypoxia. Therefore, the label for this pair is contradiction."}
{"idx": 1797, "Premise": "[**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes the patient complained of L breast pain as well as \"pins and needles coming and going\".", "Hypothesis": "The patient is not experiencing pain.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The Premise states that the patient complained of left breast pain and \"pins and needles\" sensation.

{"idx": 486, "Premise": "She received 40 mg IV lasix with minimal response.", "Hypothesis": "No change in condition after treatment with diuretic", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient received a diuretic, specifically 40 mg IV lasix. The hypothesis states that there was no change in the patient's condition after treatment with the diuretic. Since the premise provides information that the diuretic had minimal response, it logically follows that there was no change in the patient's condition after treatment. Therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, and the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 1806, "Premise": "BIPAP was replaced with nasal cannulae, and he was saturating 97% on 2L.", "Hypothesis": "the patient has improving respiratory function", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "First, we know that the patient was previously on BIPAP, which is a form of non-invasive ventilation often used for patients with respiratory distress. The premise then states that the BIPAP was replaced with nasal cannulae, which is a less invasive form of oxygen delivery. Finally, the premise reports that the patient was saturating at 97% on 2L, which indicates adequate oxygenation. Therefore, it logically follows that the patient's respiratory function is improving, as they are able to maintain adequate oxygen levels with less invasive support. Thus, the label of entailment is appropriate."}
{"idx": 7671, "Premise": "CPAP was initiated and patient's mental status had mild improvement in alertness.", "Hypothesis": "Patient became more alert after treatment", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "If CPAP was initiated, it means the patient had respiratory distress or difficulty breathing. The purpose of CPAP is to improve oxygenation and reduce the work of breathing. If the patient's oxygenation improved, it's likely that their mental status also improved, as the brain requires oxygen to function properly. Therefore, the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise, which is why the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 1804, "Premise": "She was seen in the clinic and was tachycardic and hypoxic with a room air saturation of 88 and was admitted.", "Hypothesis": "Her vitals were within normal limits", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient was admitted to the hospital and had abnormal vital signs, including a low oxygen saturation level. This contradicts the hypothesis, which claims that the patient's vitals were within normal limits. Therefore, the label for this pair is contradiction."}
{"idx": 10971, "Premise": "Was found to have a supratherapeutic INR @ 4.8 and was reversed with 2 Units FFP and IV vitamin K.", "Hypothesis": "The patient is anticoagulated.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient had a supratherapeutic INR (a measure of blood clotting) and was reversed with FFP (fresh frozen plasma) and IV vitamin K (a medication used to reverse the effects of blood thinners). This implies that the patient was taking anticoagulants, which caused the elevated INR. Therefore, the hypothesis that the patient is anticoagulated logically follows from the premise. Hence, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 8330, "Premise": "She denies fevers, chills, cough, and dysuria.", "Hypothesis": "The patient does not have a urinary tract infection.", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient denies specific symptoms, including dysuria, which is a common symptom of urinary tract infections.

The Hypothesis assumes that the patient has a congenital heart defect, but there's no evidence to support or refute this claim in the Premise. Therefore, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 9105, "Premise": "She was admitted to the MICU for antibiotic treatment and was weaned to 2L O2 by n/c.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has an infection.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient was admitted to the MICU for antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics are typically used to treat infections. Therefore, it logically follows that the patient has an infection, which is the conclusion in the hypothesis. The information in the premise entails the conclusion in the hypothesis, hence the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 2587, "Premise": "No visual or hearing changes, problems swallowing, hearing problems, or other sx except as above.", "Hypothesis": "there are new visual field defects", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The Premise states that there are no visual changes, while the Hypothesis claims the presence of new visual field defects. These two statements contradict each other, hence the label contradiction."}
{"idx": 2215, "Premise": "She felt very tired and fatigued since then and was slightly dizzy.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has been fulling full of energy.", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient felt tired and fatigued and was slightly dizzy. However, the hypothesis contradicts this by stating that the patient has been full of energy. These two statements cannot be true at the same time, hence the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 7129, "Premise": "He was started on NAC q4hr with gradual decline in LFT's and INR.", "Hypothesis": "His liver function is normal", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that there was a decline in LFT's and INR after starting NAC. This suggests that there was an issue with liver function. However, the hypothesis asserts that the liver function is normal. These two statements contradict each other, hence the label of contradiction."}
{"idx": 2303, "Premise": "H/O mult blood transfusions for UGIB after ERCP with sphincterotomy a few years ago.", "Hypothesis": "patient had gall stones in the past.", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The Premise states that the patient had multiple blood transfusions due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) after undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy a few years ago. The Hypothesis suggests that the patient had gallstones in the past. However, the Premise does not provide any information about gallstones, it only mentions UGIB after a medical procedure. Therefore, the label is neutral as the Premise does not confirm or deny the Hypothesis."}
{"idx": 11124, "Premise": "The patient reports living in a hotel and picking up drinking immediately, drinking daily a quart of scotch.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has alcoholism", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "Living in a hotel and picking up drinking immediately are both indicators of a potential alcohol problem. Drinking a quart of scotch daily is a clear sign of alcohol abuse. Therefore, the information in the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the information in the premise, so the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 1308, "Premise": "Upon arrival in the ED, temp 101.1, HR 115, BP 121/108, RR 18, and pulse ox 98% on 4L NC.", "Hypothesis": "High heart rate", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "A high heart rate is defined as a heart rate above the normal range, which is typically between 60-100 beats per minute. The premise states that the patient has a heart rate of 115, which is above the normal range and therefore can be classified as a high heart rate. Therefore, the information in the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis, making the label entailment."}
{"idx": 9801, "Premise": "The patient was neurologically intact throughout the case.", "Hypothesis": "The patient did not develop new neurological defecits during the procedure.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "If the patient was neurologically intact throughout the case, it means that they did not have any neurological deficits. This information directly confirms the hypothesis that the patient did not develop any new neurological deficits during the procedure. Therefore, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 10487, "Premise": "Pt is a 64 y/o M hx CAD, DM, HTN, ESRD on HD and MMP who presents with fever and dyspnea.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has pneumonia.", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "First, we know the patient has a history of CAD, DM, HTN, ESRD on HD, and MMP. Second, the patient presents with fever and dyspnea. Third, the hypothesis is that the patient has pneumonia. While the symptoms presented could be consistent with pneumonia, the premise does not provide enough information to definitively support or refute the hypothesis. Therefore, the label is neutral."}
