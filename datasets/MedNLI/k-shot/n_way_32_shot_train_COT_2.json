{"idx": 2826, "Premise": "There was no meconium noted at delivery.", "Hypothesis": "The patient is not at risk of meconium aspiration.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "If there was no meconium noted at delivery, it means that the baby did not pass stool before birth. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the patient is not at risk of meconium aspiration (inhaling the stool into the lungs), as there was no meconium present to begin with. The information in the premise leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis, so the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 1514, "Premise": "On returning late that night, he had great difficulty climbing the stairs to his bedroom.", "Hypothesis": "The patient complains of weakness", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise describes the patient having difficulty climbing the stairs to his bedroom, which can be interpreted as weakness, but it does not confirm whether or not the patient actually complained of weakness.

{"idx": 2859, "Premise": "3 days PTA, the pts wife noted that the pt suddenly turned pale and his sats were 78% on RA, HR 130s.", "Hypothesis": "The patient was tachycardia and hypoxic.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient's wife noticed that the patient turned pale and had low oxygen saturation levels (78%) on room air, as well as a high heart rate (130s). From this information, we can logically conclude that the patient was both tachycardic (having a high heart rate) and hypoxic (having low oxygen levels). This means that the information in the premise entails the conclusion in the hypothesis, making the label entailment appropriate."}
{"idx": 3428, "Premise": "The patient was transported by medical flight to [**Hospital1 47**] for further evaluation.", "Hypothesis": "The patient was comatose", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise informs us that the patient was transported to a hospital for further evaluation, but it does not provide any information about the patient's state of consciousness.

The results of the LP show the presence of 2 WBC (white blood cells) and a protein level of 32, which are both indicative of an immune response to an infection. The absence of RBC (red blood cells) rules out the possibility of a hemorrhage. Additionally, the glucose level of 92 is within the normal range, which rules out the possibility of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Therefore, the information provided in the premise supports the hypothesis that the patient has evidence of an infection. As a result, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 2894, "Premise": "After CT and magnetic resonance imaging, she was transferred to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit.", "Hypothesis": "the patient has intracranial hemorrhage", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise indicates that the patient underwent CT and MRI scans and was transferred to the Neurology ICU, which suggests a neurological condition.

Therefore, the label is neutral as the hypothesis is a potential explanation, but it's not confirmed by the premise."}
{"idx": 9722, "Premise": "Hypertension Prostate ca Pacemaker [**3251-5-26**] s/p TIA s/p syncope s/p occipital craniotomy s/p appendectomy", "Hypothesis": "the patient is elderly", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise lists several medical conditions and procedures, but none of them necessarily indicate the patient's age. Therefore, the hypothesis that the patient is elderly cannot be confirmed or refuted based on the premise alone. Hence, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 3018, "Premise": "Of note, the patient also was found to have a platelet count of 30 on admission to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has thrombocytopenia", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The Premise states that the patient has a platelet count of 30, which is below the normal range and indicates thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the Hypothesis can be inferred from the Premise, making it an entailment relationship."}
{"idx": 4311, "Premise": "[**Name (NI) 10269**] Pt is on chronic prednisone for his sarcoidosis.", "Hypothesis": "Pt is on steroid medication", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise explicitly states that the patient is on chronic prednisone. Prednisone is a steroid medication commonly used to treat various conditions, including sarcoidosis. Therefore, the hypothesis that the patient is on steroid medication is strongly supported by the premise. The information in the premise logically leads to the hypothesis, and the hypothesis is a necessary conclusion drawn from the premise. Hence, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 8262, "Premise": "EMS reported that K was 7.9 today, initially though to be post-HD (now seems more likely to have been pre-HD).", "Hypothesis": "Potassium levels were high", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The Premise mentions that EMS reported a K value of 7.9, which is a high value for potassium. The Hypothesis states that potassium levels were high. Therefore, the Hypothesis is an accurate conclusion that can be drawn from the information given in the Premise. Hence, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 420, "Premise": "At [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 614**], she was found to be tachycardic to the 120s in AF and hypotensive w/ SBP in 90s.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has low blood pressure", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient was found to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s. The hypothesis directly corresponds to this information by stating that the patient has low blood pressure. Therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, leading to the entailment label."}
{"idx": 1348, "Premise": "In the Emergency Room she was found to have a blood pressure of 130/palp with a heart rate of 72.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has panic attacks", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient has a blood pressure of 130/palp and a heart rate of 72, which could be indicative of a medical condition. However, the hypothesis claims that the patient has panic attacks, which are not typically associated with high blood pressure and heart rate. Therefore, there is a contradiction between the two statements, leading to the label of contradiction."}
{"idx": 9570, "Premise": "He states that he has frequent chest pain with minimal exertion or exposure to cold.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has angina", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "If the patient experiences frequent chest pain, it is an indication that something is wrong with their heart. Angina is a common condition that causes chest pain or discomfort when the heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Therefore, if the patient reports frequent chest pain, it logically follows that they may have angina. This logical connection between the premise and hypothesis results in the entailment label."}
{"idx": 3693, "Premise": "Chest x-ray with an official read of mild interstitial edema, questionable right upper lobe infiltrate.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has mild pulmonary edema.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the chest x-ray shows mild interstitial edema and a questionable right upper lobe infiltrate. Mild interstitial edema is a sign of pulmonary edema, which means that there is excess fluid in the lungs. Therefore, the information in the premise (chest x-ray showing mild interstitial edema) logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis (the patient has mild pulmonary edema). This means that the label for this Premise-Hypothesis pair is entailment."}
{"idx": 2401, "Premise": "Today he decided he wanted to live and therefore called EMS to bring him to [**Hospital1 22**].", "Hypothesis": "The patient is unable to make phone calls.", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient called EMS to bring him to the hospital, indicating that the patient was able to make a phone call. However, the hypothesis contradicts this by stating that the patient is unable to make phone calls. Therefore, there is a contradiction between the two statements, and the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 2416, "Premise": "Her heart rate on the drip was noted to be high in the 150s, and she was treated with IV diltiazem and Lopressor to help slow that down.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has normal vital signs", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient's heart rate was high and required medication to lower it. However, the hypothesis claims that the patient has normal vital signs, which would include a normal heart rate. These two statements contradict each other, resulting in a contradiction label."}
{"idx": 7361, "Premise": "She also reports while in the ambulance she felt like she could not take a complete breath in.", "Hypothesis": "She has a history of asthma", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise mentions that the patient felt like she could not take a complete breath in, but it does not provide any information about the cause of this symptom. The hypothesis suggests that the patient might have a history of asthma, but there is no confirmation or denial of this in the premise. Therefore, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 6972, "Premise": "She was d/c'd from [**Hospital1 909**] on Sunday night w/o abx, to attend her [**Hospital **] clinic appointment at [**Hospital1 68**].", "Hypothesis": "the patient was discharged from the hospital.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The Premise states that the patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 909**] on Sunday night. The Hypothesis simply restates this fact. Therefore, the Hypothesis can be inferred directly from the Premise, making the label entailment."}
{"idx": 9625, "Premise": "Per anesthesia resident, there was concern that the pt would be a diffficult intubation given body habitus.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has no concerns for intubation.", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise mentions that there was concern for a difficult intubation due to the patient's body habitus. However, the hypothesis states that there are no concerns for intubation. These two statements contradict each other, as one suggests difficulty while the other suggests ease. Therefore, the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 7474, "Premise": "She was treated with IV fluids to maintain her BP which held stable with SBPs in the 80s.", "Hypothesis": "The patient is hypertensive.", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient's blood pressure was maintained with SBPs (systolic blood pressure) in the 80s, which is not consistent with hypertension (high blood pressure). Therefore, the hypothesis that the patient is hypertensive contradicts the information provided in the premise, resulting in the label of contradiction."}
{"idx": 3772, "Premise": "He was shocked multiple times and intubated in the field, and transferred to [**Location (un) **].", "Hypothesis": "The patient has pulseless electrical activity.", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient was shocked multiple times and intubated in the field, which suggests that the patient was in a critical condition. However, the hypothesis states that the patient has pulseless electrical activity, which means that the heart is not pumping effectively. These two statements contradict each other because if the patient had pulseless electrical activity, it would be unlikely that they would be shocked and intubated in the field. Therefore, the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 4421, "Premise": "The risks were explained to her and she agreed to proceed with operation to close her atrioseptal defect.", "Hypothesis": "the patient has a septum secundum ASD", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise states that the risks of the operation were explained to the patient, and she agreed to proceed with it. It does not mention anything about the type or location of the atrioseptal defect. The hypothesis assumes that the patient has a septum secundum ASD, but the premise does not confirm or deny this assumption. Therefore, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 1730, "Premise": "On the day of admission the patient noted the onset of another severe headache.", "Hypothesis": "the patient has subarachnoid hemorrhage", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The Premise confirms that the patient experienced a severe headache on the day of admission. However, the Premise does not provide any further information that could confirm or rule out the possibility of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Therefore, the Hypothesis is not supported or refuted by the Premise, and the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 6384, "Premise": "The night before admission, the patient had fallen out of bed twice, striking himself against a filing cabinet.", "Hypothesis": "the patient had multiple falls", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient fell out of bed twice, which implies that the patient had multiple falls. Therefore, the content of the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the information provided in the premise. Hence, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 8398, "Premise": "Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.", "Hypothesis": "The patient complains of lightheadedness", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise lists various symptoms that are not present in the patient, including syncope or presyncope, which are related to lightheadedness. Therefore, the absence of syncope or presyncope in the premise implies that the patient is not experiencing lightheadedness. However, the hypothesis states that the patient is complaining of lightheadedness. This contradicts the information provided in the premise, leading to a contradiction label."}
{"idx": 5123, "Premise": "He was noticed to have a rise in his creatinine and while awaiting cardiac clearance and a renal consultation, the patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has AKI", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient had a rise in creatinine levels and was awaiting cardiac and renal consultations. The hypothesis suggests that the patient has acute kidney injury (AKI). While the rise in creatinine levels can be indicative of AKI, it is not enough to confirm the diagnosis. The patient's renal consultation and further testing would be required to confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 9711, "Premise": "Pt unable to answer questions, unable to assess for ROS. .", "Hypothesis": "Patient is a poor historian", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient was unable to answer questions and assess for ROS (review of systems). This implies that the patient cannot provide a detailed medical history, which aligns with the content of the hypothesis that the patient is a poor historian. Therefore, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 7745, "Premise": "Apgars were 8 and 9 at one and five minutes of age respectively.", "Hypothesis": "The patient was born in a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery.", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "First, the premise provides information about the Apgar scores of the newborn, which are indicators of a newborn's physical health and well-being. However, the hypothesis only states that the patient was born through a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery, which does not necessarily indicate anything about the newborn's health. Therefore, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 11062, "Premise": "This regimen successfully controlled the patient's pain and she was discharged on this regimen.", "Hypothesis": "The regimen was unsuccessful in controlling the patient's pain", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient's pain was successfully controlled with the regimen. However, the hypothesis claims that the same regimen was unsuccessful in controlling the patient's pain. These two statements directly oppose each other, and therefore, the label for this pair is contradiction."}
{"idx": 581, "Premise": "They were eventually able to place a right SC line. .", "Hypothesis": "the patient has poor peripheral access", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The Premise states that the medical team was able to place a right SC line. The Hypothesis suggests that the patient has poor peripheral access, which may have led to the need for a central line. However, the Premise does not provide any information about the reason for the central line placement. It could have been due to poor peripheral access, but it could have also been for other reasons such as the need for long-term IV access or for monitoring purposes. As a result, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 7805, "Premise": "He received resuscitation with [**3165**] cc of normal saline and one unit of packed red blood cells.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has anemia", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient received resuscitation with saline and packed red blood cells. This indicates that the patient had some sort of blood loss or fluid depletion. However, the hypothesis simply states that the patient has anemia, which may or may not be related to the reason for resuscitation. Therefore, the label is neutral as the premise does not confirm or deny the hypothesis."}
{"idx": 4993, "Premise": "At 29 weeks AFI of 46, estimated fetal    weight in 98th percentile.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has a negative urine B hCG", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that at 29 weeks, the patient had an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 46 and the estimated fetal weight was in the 98th percentile. The hypothesis, on the other hand, asserts that the patient has a negative urine B hCG. These two statements are unrelated and do not agree with each other, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 4500, "Premise": "It has progressively gotten worse to the point that she could not take a shower or wash her face without getting SOB.", "Hypothesis": "The patient has a condition that causes decreased end organ perfusion.", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient experiences shortness of breath (SOB) when taking a shower or washing her face. This implies that there is a problem with the patient's breathing. The hypothesis suggests that the patient has a condition that causes decreased end organ perfusion, which means that the organs are not receiving enough blood flow. If the organs, including the lungs, are not receiving enough blood flow, it could cause difficulty breathing, which is consistent with the symptom described in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, and the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 6450, "Premise": "During the procedure he was found to have low cardiac output index with cardiac output 3.7 and index of 1.78, necessitated input of an intra-aortic balloon pump.", "Hypothesis": "There is abnormal cardiac function", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "First, the premise states that the patient has low cardiac output index, which indicates that there is an issue with the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. Second, it mentions that an intra-aortic balloon pump was needed to address this issue. Both of these pieces of information provide strong support for the hypothesis that there is abnormal cardiac function. Therefore, the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 7803, "Premise": "He received resuscitation with [**3165**] cc of normal saline and one unit of packed red blood cells.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has hypotension", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient received resuscitation with a large amount of normal saline and packed red blood cells. This suggests that the patient was in a critical condition, possibly due to hypotension. Therefore, the hypothesis that the patient has hypotension is strongly supported by the premise, making the label entailment."}
{"idx": 9769, "Premise": "This patient was complicated by preterm premature rupture of membranes of sibling, less than 24 hours prior to delivery and preterm labor.", "Hypothesis": "The patient delivered at term.", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The premise states that the patient had preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor. These conditions suggest that the patient gave birth before reaching full term. However, the hypothesis states that the patient delivered at term, which contradicts the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 2595, "Premise": "Prenatal screen: Blood type B positive, antibody negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune.", "Hypothesis": "Patient has blood type B+", "label": "entailment", "CoT": "The first part of the premise states that the patient's blood type is B positive. Therefore, the hypothesis that the patient has blood type B+ logically follows from the information provided in the premise. Hence, the label is entailment."}

These are all treatments for heart disease. Therefore, it can be concluded that the patient has a history of heart disease. The hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, so the label is entailment."}
{"idx": 2605, "Premise": "Currently controlled on PO lasix, in normal sinus rythm .", "Hypothesis": "The patient is not prescribed medication.", "label": "contradiction", "CoT": "The Premise states that the patient is currently taking PO lasix, which is a medication used to treat fluid buildup in the body, and also mentions that the patient is in normal sinus rhythm, meaning their heart is beating regularly. However, the Hypothesis claims that the patient is not prescribed medication, which contradicts the information provided in the Premise. Therefore, the label is contradiction."}
{"idx": 2606, "Premise": "Currently controlled on PO lasix, in normal sinus rythm .", "Hypothesis": "The patient has congestive heart failure.", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise tells us that the patient is currently controlled on PO lasix and in normal sinus rhythm. While these are both relevant pieces of information when assessing a patient with congestive heart failure, they do not provide enough evidence to definitively support or refute the hypothesis that the patient has CHF. Therefore, the label is neutral."}
{"idx": 5192, "Premise": "Therefore, she had to have a resection for oncological purposes.", "Hypothesis": "She had a spinal cord tumor", "label": "neutral", "CoT": "The premise mentions a resection for oncological purposes, but it does not specify the location or type of tumor. The hypothesis suggests a spinal cord tumor, but there is no clear indication in the premise to support or refute that hypothesis. Therefore, the label is neutral."}
